# Add-Watermarks-in-PDF
Adding watermarks to a PDF refers to the process of placing an overlay on top of the existing content in a PDF file.
Watermarks are typically used to indicate ownership, confidentiality, or the status of a document. They can consist of text, images, or a combination of both.
When you add a watermark to a PDF, it becomes a permanent part of the document and cannot be easily removed or altered. The watermark is usually placed in the background of the page and does not interfere with the readability of the content.
